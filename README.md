# My Flask Application

Welcome to My Job Board Application! This is a simple Flask application that retrieves internship offers as a "Boucher"
in Rennes and a 50km radius around the city.

## Getting Started

To get started with this application, follow these steps:

1. **Download**: Download the zip file of the application from the repository.

2. **Extract**: Extract the contents of the zip file to a directory on your computer.

3. **Installation**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you extracted the zip file, and install the dependencies using the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   
    If Python and Pip are not installed on your computer, please download and install it. You will also need SQLite3 installed as I'm using this database. For more information on how to do it, check : https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_installation.htm ! Finally, you'll need an internet connexion to retrieve data from Governement API and get Bootstrap CDN.


4. **Run the Application**: Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Flask application by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

   By default, the application will be accessible at http://localhost:5000/ in your web browser.
